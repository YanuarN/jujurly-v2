## This Frontend Service from Jujurly Feedback - Jujurly

First , I create the project using React Vite JS enviroment to get pretty create for react js framework.

## Build With

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- [React JS](https://react.dev/) - React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro/) - Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser
- [Atomic Design](hhttps://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) - Atomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages concurrently working together to create effective interface design systems

## FYI

- First, i create the project with next ts configuration
- After that we manage the state managament using redux
- Configuration Axios for fetchinable API Service
- Use pattern structure with atomic design

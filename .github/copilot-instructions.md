create a webapp (microservice style, react+vite frontend, python backend) with a main goal to take anonymous and candid feedback to a person

so this person register, then they will be generated a link that other anon users can open

once an anon user open the link, they can tell who they are (how they met the person, a classmate, anything including names) and a big textbox about what they are feeling towards the person,

and maybe an extra smaller textbox asking the context of this feedback

once submitted, the anon can add their email if they wanna be updated about “has the user read your feedback?”

on the user side, they can only see the summary of the feedback(s). Eleminating all the curse words, anger, over aggressive, taunt, etc. Without leaving the context of that feedback or even making it more structural. We use LLM for this

i plan to make usable in casual yet professional settings (between indonesian gen z workers), so in terms of frontend design, make it chill, much like ngl.link
